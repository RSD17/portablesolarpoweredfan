            <p>Imagine this. You see the sun out. You think that it is a pleasant day to go out for a walk. But 15 mins in and the scorching heat gets to you. You cannot go on. Worn out and disappointed, you walk back home. If you have experienced this feeling of total dissatisfaction and exasperation, you're not the only one. <br><br> If we look at the statistics, we can see that world temperatures have been increasing at a rate of 0.18°C per year since the 1980s! This is not only hazardous for the environment but it also causes several inconveniences for us people. The weather gets so hot that many of our bodies cannot handle it and we start feeling tremendously uncomfortable. Now, it is extremely hard to come up with a singular solution to global warming as it is a rather complex topic and there is no one product that can single-handedly resolve this issue. <br><br> Instead, I am coming up with a solution that can help ease some of our pain and discomfort our bodies feel from the blistering heat. This portable solar-powered fan will eliminate nearly all of the inconveniences and nuisances we feel from the belting heat.  This product is easily portable, so you can use it wherever you want, whenever you want, without any hassle. It is made almost entirely from eco-friendly and recycled materials. The product is ergonomically designed, cost-effective, compact, functional and highly effective and beneficial, especially during the summer. <br><br> <strong>Note</strong> that it is strongly discouraged for anyone <strong>below the age of 5</strong> to use this product without adult supervision</p>
